I was intelligent enough not to install it on my mobile devices that use metered internet connections. I have enough trouble with Google Android.

All this crap NEVER updates when an unlimited DSL connection is available, only decides to do so at the worst possible moment: 2a: When I want to use a mobile device 2b1: Even this interface sucks. Mind of its own.  Have anyone there heard of standard API? 2b2: When the updates wait until the device is on a metered connection, even though an unlimited connection was previously available.
